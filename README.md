# ptv_api_frankstonline
My first effort at using Django. This project makes use of Google Maps and the PTV api. It works for the frankston line ending at Flinders Street Station, but doesn't include the loop stations.
Several of the scripts that create the stops.py, routes.py etc. can be confalted into a single initialisation script if required.
