# ptv_api_frankstonline
Django (1st effort). This project makes use of Google Maps and the PTV api. It works for the frankston line ending at Flinders Street Station, but doesn't include the loop stations.
Todo: Several of the scripts that create the stops.py, routes.py etc. can be merged into a single script if required.
